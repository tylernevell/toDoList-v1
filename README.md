# TODO LIST

This is a Web App that operates as a list where you can keep track of what you need to do during the day!

Add items to the list by entering your activity and pressing enter, or click on the "+" on the screen. To delete items, click the checkbox to indicate those items have been completed.

Built using Node.js, with EJS as the frontend and Express.js + MongoDB + Mongoose as the backend. Utilized Dotenv to protect passwords.
